Question 7
Assume that there is a function MID with the syntax, MID(s1,m,n) where s1 a string, and m and n
are integers. Given that MID(s1,m,n) is to return n middle characters of s1 starting from the
character at position m, write a computer solution that accepts as input a string of characters and
output the number of times a particular character appears in the input.
